# ðŸ”¥ Fire Detection Project
ðŸš’ **Detecting Fire and Non-Fire Images with Advanced CNN Architectures**

This project aims to develop a highly accurate fire detection system using **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** and compare its performance with popular architectures such as **AlexNet**, **VGG**, and **ResNet**. It also includes real-time detection functionality and model evaluation tools.

ðŸŒŸ Features

ðŸ”¥ Fire Detection: A custom CNN model optimized through multiple modifications for robust fire detection.
ðŸ“Š Model Comparison: Implementation of AlexNet, VGG, ResNet to compare with the custom CNN model.
ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation: Tools to evaluate models using images and real-time video streams.
âš¡ Real-Time Detection: Fire detection in live video streams using OpenCV and TensorFlow.
